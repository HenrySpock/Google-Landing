Version 1: Text description of page

Version 2: Basic Markup

Version 3: Added CSS

Version 4:
1. The leaf icon is now part of the "carbon neutral" link.
2. The title and browser tab text correctly state "Google" now, and the icon is linked as an .ico file in the head, also appearing in the browser tab. I was not able to find the exact image so I had to modify it in Photoshop, it's pretty close.
3. Footer styled with css, eliminating the bottom half of the <br>s.  
4. Footer color was correct, but now the footer *link* color is correct (darker grey as aopposed to black.)
5. Logo is now placed with margin-top, eliminating the other half of the <br>s.
6. I removed all of the "target="blank" - I link the behavior of opening a new tab, but that's not how the Google page works.
7. I removed the dropdown selector for "products" - the products button is a card, I believe, and styling that is a bit beyond the scope of a "simple" page I think. I also didn't style the search bar or the buttons.

Version 5:
1. Divs in footer reflect are starting to reflect box model, meaning I am more aware of the sizing for the footer and the child divs and was able to center the "carbon neutral" text and icon.
2. Search bar is styled for size, border and drop shadow.
3. Buttons are styled for size, color and border.
4. Piggybacking search behvior implented on search bar with action="https://www.google.com/search" applied to <form.>
5. Color of the button text is correct, instead of jet black.
6. When focusing on the search bar, it was acquiring a solid black border. This now has corrected behavior.
7. Text color for top navigation links, search buttons and subsequent exploring link is now consistent.
8. The cursor in the search bar is now indented, rather than half hidden by the left border.
9. Search icon is now visible inside search bar.
10. Placeholder text in search is visible until focus.
