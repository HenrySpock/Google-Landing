# Google-Landing
This is a wip for cloning a Google landing page. 
Version 1 was a text description of the page.
Version 2 was basic HTML. 
Version 3 added CSS.
Most of the styling occurs in version 4.
In version 5 I style the input and buttons and add a piggybacking search behavior to make the page mimic functionality.
