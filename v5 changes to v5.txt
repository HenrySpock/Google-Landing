Change log: 
1. Divs in footer reflect are starting to reflect box model, meaning I am more aware of the sizing for the footer and the child divs and was able to center the "carbon neutral" text and icon.
2. Search bar is styled for size, border and drop shadow.
3. Buttons are styled for size, color and border.
4. Piggybacking search behvior implented on search bar with action="https://www.google.com/search" applied to <form.>
5. Color of the button text is correct, instead of jet black.
6. When focusing on the search bar, it was acquiring a solid black border. This now has corrected behavior.
