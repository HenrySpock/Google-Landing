Change log: 
1. The leaf icon is now part of the "carbon neutral" link.
2. The title and browser tab text correctly state "Google" now, and the icon is linked as an .ico file in the head, also appearing in the browser tab. I was not able to find the exact image so I had to modify it in Photoshop, it's pretty close.
3. Footer styled with css, eliminating the bottom half of the <br>s.  
4. Footer color was correct, but now the footer *link* color is correct (darker grey as aopposed to black.)
5. Logo is now placed with margin-top, eliminating the other half of the <br>s.
6. I removed all of the "target="blank" - I link the behavior of opening a new tab, but that's not how the Google page works.
7. I removed the dropdown selector for "products" - the products button is a card, I believe, and styling that is a bit beyond the scope of a "simple" page I think. I also didn't style the search bar or the buttons.
